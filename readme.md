# NSS iifeIntro 

### Project Description 
This is a class application created to introduce `IIFE` (immediately-invoked function expression) coding and structure. 


#### Class Demo IIFE Screen Grab 1

### Project Specs
#### `JavaScript` IIFE basics
An `IIFE` `JavaScript` coding structure was coded/built in class as a means to demonstrate the basic properties and structure of an `iife` and dependent augmentors. 
- defined `SolarSystem.js`
- created the augmentor files: 
	- `planets.js`
	- `spaceships.js`
	- `stars.js`
	- `age.js`

The various `JavaScript` files underwent many changes throughout the class discussion (including a change from `main.js` to `realMain.js`), with additions and deletions. Part of the discussion was lost from the final *saves*. 


### Technologies Used
- `html`
- `JavaScript`


### How To View The Screen 
#### (Node must be installed on your machine):
```
git clone https://github.com/SMITHsharon/iifeIntro.git
cd iifeIntro
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8080
```

This will show in your browser at: `http://localhost:8080`

You must open the Developer Console to view the `JavaScript` output (`console.log()`s).
